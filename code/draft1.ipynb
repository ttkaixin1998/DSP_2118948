      "(a) section 35(1) sets out the first data protection principle (requirement that\n",
      "processing be lawful and fair);\n",
      "(b) section 36(1) sets out the second data protection principle (requirement that\n",
      "purposes of processing be specified, explicit and legitimate);\n",
      "(c) section 37 sets out the third data protection principle (requirement that\n",
      "personal data be adequate, relevant and not excessive);\n",

      "Document Generated: 2022-08-03\n",
      "Status:  This is the original version (as it was originally enacted).\n",
      "(3) The controller in relation to personal data is responsible for, and must be able to\n",
      "demonstrate, compliance with this Chapter.\n",
      "35 The first data protection principle\n",
      "(1) The first data protection principle is that the processing of personal data for any of the\n",
      "law enforcement purposes must be lawful and fair.\n",
      "(2) The processing of personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes is lawful\n",
      "only if and to the extent that it is based on law and either—\n",
      "(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing for that purpose, or\n",
      "(b) the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for that\n",
      "purpose by a competent authority.\n",
      "(3) In addition, where the processing for any of the law enforcement purposes is sensitive\n",
      "processing, the processing is permitted only in the two cases set out in subsections\n",
      "(4) and (5).\n",
      "(4) The first case is where—\n",
      "(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing for the law enforcement\n",
      "purpose as mentioned in subsection (2)(a), and\n",
      "(b) at the time when the processing is carried out, the controller has an appropriate\n",
      "policy document in place (see section 42).\n",
      "(5) The second case is where—\n",
      "(a) the processing is strictly necessary for the law enforcement purpose,\n",
      "(b) the processing meets at least one of the conditions in Schedule 8, and\n",
      "(c) at the time when the processing is carried out, the controller has an appropriate\n",
      "policy document in place (see section 42).\n",
      "(6) The Secretary of State may by regulations amend Schedule 8—\n",
      "(a) by adding conditions;\n",
      "(b) by omitting conditions added by regulations under paragraph (a).\n",
      "(7) Regulations under subsection (6) are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.\n",
      "(8) In this section, “sensitive processing” means—\n",
      "(a) the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political\n",
      "opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or trade union membership;\n",
      "(b) the processing of genetic data, or of biometric data, for the purpose of uniquely\n",
      "identifying an individual;\n",
      "(c) the processing of data concerning health;\n",
      "(d) the processing of data concerning an individual’s sex life or sexual orientation.\n",
      "36 The second data protection principle\n",
      "(1) The second data protection principle is that—\n",
      "(a) the law enforcement purpose for which personal data is collected on any\n",
      "occasion must be specified, explicit and legitimate, and\n",
      "(b) personal data so collected must not be processed in a manner that is\n",
      "incompatible with the purpose for which it was collected.\n",

      "(2) Paragraph (b) of the second data protection principle is subject to subsections (3) and\n",

      "(3) Personal data collected for a law enforcement purpose may be processed for any\n",
      "other law enforcement purpose (whether by the controller that collected the data or by\n",
      "another controller) provided that—\n",
      "(a) the controller is authorised by law to process the data for the other purpose,\n",
      "and\n",
      "(b) the processing is necessary and proportionate to that other purpose.\n",
      "(4) Personal data collected for any of the law enforcement purposes may not be processed\n",
      "for a purpose that is not a law enforcement purpose unless the processing is authorised\n",
      "by law.\n",
      "37 The third data protection principle\n",
      "The third data protection principle is that personal data processed for any of the law\n",
      "enforcement purposes must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the\n",
      "purpose for which it is processed.\n",
      "38 The fourth data protection principle\n",
      "(1) The fourth data protection principle is that—\n",
      "(a) personal data processed for any of the law enforcement purposes must be\n",
      "accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date, and\n",
      "(b) every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that is\n",
      "inaccurate, having regard to the law enforcement purpose for which it is\n",
      "processed, is erased or rectified without delay.\n",
      "(2) In processing personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes, personal data\n",
      "based on facts must, so far as possible, be distinguished from personal data based on\n",
      "personal assessments.\n",
      "(3) In processing personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes, a clear distinction\n",
      "must, where relevant and as far as possible, be made between personal data relating\n",
      "to different categories of data subject, such as—\n",
      "(a) persons suspected of having committed or being about to commit a criminal\n",
      "offence;\n",
      "(b) persons convicted of a criminal offence;\n",
      "(c) persons who are or may be victims of a criminal offence;\n",
      "(d) witnesses or other persons with information about offences.\n",
      "(4) All reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that personal data which is inaccurate,\n",
      "incomplete or no longer up to date is not transmitted or made available for any of the\n",
      "law enforcement purposes.\n",
      "(5) For that purpose—\n",
      "(a) the quality of personal data must be verified before it is transmitted or made\n",
      "available,\n",
      "(b) in all transmissions of personal data, the necessary information enabling the\n",
      "recipient to assess the degree of accuracy, completeness and reliability of the\n",
      "data and the extent to which it is up to date must be included, and\n",
