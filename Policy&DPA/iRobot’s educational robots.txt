Data at Rest: Within iRobot’s cloud (built on top of Google and AWS), customer data is stored encrypted. Within the iRobot Coding Companion App, data storage follows the platform’s standards for application-secure data.

Data Center Security: iRobot takes a defense-in-depth approach to security, adding multiple layers of protection around our robots, cloud and apps from start to finish. The development of iRobot products follows industry-standard security best practices, and iRobot uses technology-leading tools to assist development and security teams during this process. When deployed to market, iRobot works with suppliers and partners to ensure that supporting infrastructure (including physical infrastructure, cloud, and mobile apps) are properly configured and monitored, and continuous security improvement processes are in place. All the data collected from your iRobot products per this Privacy Policy is handled with care and high levels of security. Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. Data access is controlled strictly and limited only to authorized personnel to do their job and help improve your product experiences.
